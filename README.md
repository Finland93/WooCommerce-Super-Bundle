## 🚀 What Is WooCommerce Super Bundle?

**WooCommerce Super Bundle** helps you sell more by turning ordinary products into **powerful custom bundles** — all without paying for a premium plugin.  

Whether you want **open bundles** (where customers choose items within limits) or **closed bundles** (predefined product sets), this plugin delivers everything you need to **increase Average Order Value (AOV)**, **boost conversions**, and **create flexible offers** — all inside WooCommerce.

Built for speed, simplicity, and compatibility, Super Bundle gives you pro-level control over pricing, variations, discounts, and inventory—without the clutter or license keys.

## 💸 Why It’s 100% Free Forever

Super Bundle is released under the **GPL v2+ license**, meaning:
- ✅ **Open Source** — you can use, modify, and share it freely.  
- 🚫 **No paid upgrades, trials, or upsells.** Ever.  
- ❤️ Built by developers who believe **core eCommerce tools should stay free** and accessible to everyone, especially small businesses and solo store owners.

If you like it, just star ⭐ the repo or contribute via pull requests — that’s the only “payment” we ask.
