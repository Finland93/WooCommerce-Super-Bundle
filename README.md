## Description

The **WooCommerce Super Bundle** plugin enhances your WooCommerce store by allowing sellers to create product bundles to boost sales and offer discounts. This plugin supports two types of bundles:

- **Open Bundles**: Customers can select a predefined minimum and maximum number of products (e.g., 2-5 items) from a curated list, including support for variable products with variation options.
- **Closed Bundles**: Predefined sets of products where customers cannot modify the contents, perfect for promoting fixed discount packs.

Key features include a user-friendly frontend interface, seamless integration with all WooCommerce product types, and flexible pricing options (fixed price or percentage discount).

### Why Choose WooCommerce Super Bundle?
- Increase average order value with bundle offers.
- Compatible with variable products and all WooCommerce features.
